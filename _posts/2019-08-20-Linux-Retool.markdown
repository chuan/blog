title: Linux Retool
---

Here are some rewrites of classic Unix command line utilities as well as a new
tool I picked up recently. In the case of the rewrites, the improvements are
noticeable. For the new tools, they increased my productivity a lot and I think
the learning is worthwhile.

- `grep` replacement: <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/" title="ripgrep">ripgrep</a>
