title: Linux Retool
---

Here are some rewrites of classic Unix command line utilities as well as a new
tool I picked up recently. In the case of the rewrites, the improvements are
noticeable. For the new tools, they increased my productivity a lot and I think
the learning is worthwhile.
- `cat`: `bat`
- `find`: `fd`
- `grep`: `ripgrep` / `rg`
- **new:** `fzf`
- **new:** `jq`
