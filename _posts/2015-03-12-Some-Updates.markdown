title: Some Updates
---

I recently switched a job internally after working on <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/" title="HdInsight">Hadoop and Azure</a> for about 3 years at Microsoft. The followings are cited from the farewell note I sent to my old colleagues.

>I thought mapreduce was interesting when I first learned Hadoop in school on Linux. When I joined Microsoft after school, it never occurred to me Microsoft would have anything to do with Hadoop let alone Linux. Incredibly, <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/02/18/the-first-azure-hosted-service-that-runs-on-linux/" title="The first Azure hosted service that runs on Linux">this</a> is <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/02/19/microsoft-releases-public-preview-of-azure-hdinsight-on-linux/" title="Microsoft Releases Public Preview of Azure HDInsight on Linux">where</a> HdInsight is at now, and I was part of it. It is a great and humble learning experience for me to build and grow the first hosted Azure service of open source software and then Linux from very beginning, and I felt lucky for that.

Now begin to build something new!
