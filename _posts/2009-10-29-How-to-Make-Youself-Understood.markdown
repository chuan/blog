title: How to Make Youself Understood

>DK: I tried to write things up in a way that was jargon-free, so the nonspecialist would understand it. What I succeeded in doing is making it so that the specialist can understand it, but if I hadn’t tried to write jargon-free, then I would have written for specialists, and then the specialists wouldn’t be able to get it either.


写给普通人看，专家能看懂；写给专家看，谁也看不懂。高德纳如是说。
