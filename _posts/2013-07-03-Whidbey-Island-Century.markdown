title: Whidbey Island Century
---

It was my first time on the island. The weather was great -- sunshine, clear sky, and not as hot as Seattle; full of scenic views on the route as well. Ride strong most of the part with avg speed > 16 mi/h. Towards the end, I felt a little tired and was dropped by the group. Forgetting my GPS on the day, I took a shortcut to finish the ride. The whole length was about the same, though elevation was about 1000ft short. Still, both distance (105.9mi) and elevation (6,538ft) broke my past records. A really memorable century ride this year!
