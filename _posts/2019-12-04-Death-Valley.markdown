title: Death Valley

What to see when visiting Death Valley:
- Rhyolite Ghost Town
- Mesquote Flat Sand Dunes
- Golden Canyon
- Artist's Drive
- Artist's Palette
- Devil's Golf Course
- Badwater Basin
- Zabriskie's Point
- Dante's View

From Las Vegas, Rhyolite and Mesquote dunes are furthest away. The rest places
are clustered together near Furnace Creek. Golden Canyon to Red Cathedral trail
takes 1.5 miles. Towards the end of the trail, there is small cave. Some
climbing is needed to reach the base of Red Cathedral which offers a great view.
